# 100 Days of Code - Python

My journey through Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.

**Goal:** Build 100 Python projects in 100 days to master programming fundamentals and prepare for a career in MLOps/ML Engineering.

## Progress Tracker

### Day 1 - Band Name Generator
Prompts the user for the name of a city and pet name through input and then prints out a band name using string concatenation.
- **Skills:** Input/output, string concatenation
- **Run:** `python day1.py`

### Day 2 - Tip Calculator
Uses floats and integers and uses input from the user to assign each one a value. The prompts ask the user for parameters for a bill which after all are taken then prints out a calculation of what each person pays.
- **Skills:** Math operations, data types, f-strings
- **Run:** `python day2.py`

### Day 3 - Treasure Island
A choose your own adventure game that utilizes if statements to guide the user through an adventure game. The right decisions lead to more of the story and treasure where as wrong choices end the program.
- **Skills:** if elif and else statements, ascii art
- **Run:** `python day3.py`

### Day 4 - Rock Paper Scissors
A simple program that uses the random module to allow the user to play rock paper scissors against the program itself. Winning drawing or losing all print different end results and utilizes ascii art to show the choices of each side.
- **Skills:** random module with integers, <,>, and, or operators within if elif statements
- **Run:** `python day4.py`

### Day 5 - Password Generator
A program that allows the user to ask for the amount of letters symbols and numbers they want in a password. Then it is generated and printed out in random order for truly random passwords.
- **Skills:** more random module, .shuffle and .join for password shuffling and combining, for loops, lists
- **Run:** `python day5.py`

### Day 7 - Hangman Game
A program in the form of a game that allows the user to guess letters for a random word. If the user guesses wrong they are prompted with an ascii art a life lossed and the letter they guessed, eventually leading to a won text or lost text if lives reach 0.
- **Skill:** import and from keywords, multiple program files, if elif and else statements, for and while loop requirements
- **Run:** `python day 7.py`
